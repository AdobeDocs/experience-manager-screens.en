# Basics of a Digital Signage Project {#basics-digital-signage}

Before diving into AEM Screens implementation best practices,it is important to think of the project as a digital signage project, instead of a traditional software development.

This section provides recommendations on major key elements that are critical  before an AEM Screens project implementation.


## Key Elements in Digital Signage {#key-elements}

The *Key Elements* in a digital signage project are:

Defining the key elements is essential before implementing a digital signage project:

1. **Hardware**

   Hardware defines what hardware components are ideal for your digital signage project implementation:
   * Have we allowed for video cable type and length?
   * Physical copper wire
   * Size of screens
   * Number of screens
     * orientation
     * aspect ratio
     * resolution preference

1. **Connectivity**

   Connectivity emphasizes on the following questions:
   * Networked (cell or wi-fi) or standalone?
     * do we need to allow for USB content updates?
     * do we need to allow for usage data collection?
  
1. **Installation**

   Installation includes:
   * Displays: landscape or portrait
   * How will the screen be mounted?
     * Portrait vs. landscape
     * Full housing
     * Cover plate
   * Fixture support
   * Personnel: responsible for installing the equipment and connecting it to the network
   * How far away is the power source from the fixture?

1. **Content**

   Content includes:
   * Single zone or Multi-zone?
     * How many media assets are on the screen at the same time?
     * How many pages for interactive applications?
     * Define the UI Loop
     * Data Driven content?
   * Version Control
   
1. **Interactive**
  
   Interactive includes:
   * Preferred touchscreen type?(resistive, capacitive, multi-touch)?
     * Button press
     * Gesture
   * Data triggering (I/O)?
     * Sending/Receiving serial commands (contact closure, PLC, etc.)
     * Incoming data goes on the screen (RSS) or triggers content
     * RFID/NFC/Bluetooth/iBeacon

1. **Environment**

   Environment emphasizes on:
   * Display location?
     * Inside
     * Outside
   * Special temp requirement?
   * Vandal proof?
   * High ambient light?

1. **Maintenance**

   Maintenance emphasizes on:

   * Are detailed installation guides/user guides required?
   * Are we configuring (programming) the device prior to shipment?
   * Do we need to capture each serial number for tracking purposes?
   * Are there any back-up power requirements (uninterruptable power supply)?
