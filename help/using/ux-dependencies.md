1. Will interactions (that is, touchscreen, motion detection) required?

1. What is the purpose of the digital signage?

   * Is it for product configuration?
   * Is it wayfinding?
   * Does it show advertisements?

1. How are connections and network wiring set up?

1. How often will the computers and connection be on and off?

1. Does the fixture design support accessibility?

1. Are multiple devices required for one display (such as, multi-zones, extra large boards)?

1. What are the environmental considerations such as brightness, temperature, and the season?
