As your project has progressed from a strategic vision to a wireframed reality, you should now start preparing for the tasks necessary to actually create a Screens project in AEM that you can deploy.

This project includes the mapping of platform-specific configurations to loosely defined requirements defined in the prototyping phase.

Examples include how and when to use the following:

* **Experience Fragments** for creating content groupings.
* **Content Fragments** for creating text variations.
* **Context Hub** for creating external data stores, SPA's for interactive experiences.
* **OSGi services** for network alerts.
* **Asset Link** for Creative Cloud sourcing.
* **Network Folders** for Asset allocation.
* **Text overlay** for real-time data.
* **Schedules** for display/channels groupings.
* **Workflows** for automated content edits.

In this phase, review all the required tasks and activities that require attention and properly document them so assigned tasks can be properly tracked in the deployment phase.

Also, review all pre-defined activities as possible candidates for automation in this phase.
