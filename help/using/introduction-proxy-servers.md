# Introduction to Standard Network Setups {#intro-standard-networks}

A Network Setup can have various structures. This section provides an overview of the network structures deployed in an environment.

## Proxy Servers {#proxy-servers}

A proxy server is a dedicated computer or a software system running on a computer that acts as an intermediary between an endpoint device, such as a computer, and another server from which a user or client is requesting a service. The proxy server can exist in the same machine as a firewall server or it can be on a separate server, which forwards requests through the firewall.

An advantage of a proxy server is that it's cache can serve all users. If one or more Internet sites are frequently requested, these are likely to be in the proxy's cache, which will improve user response time. A proxy can also log its interactions, which can be helpful for troubleshooting.
