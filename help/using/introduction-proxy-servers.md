# Introduction to Standard Network Setups {#intro-standard-networks}

A Network Setup can have various structures. This section provides an overview of the network structures deployed in an environment. There are different setups that are sometimes implemented from scratch.

This section highlights an introduction to proxy servers followed by the different network structures that are setup withing different organizations. 

## Proxy Servers {#proxy-servers}

A proxy server is a dedicated computer or a software system running on a computer that acts as an intermediary between an endpoint device, such as a computer, and another server from which a user or client is requesting a service. The proxy server can exist in the same machine as a firewall server or it can be on a separate server, which forwards requests through the firewall.

An advantage of a proxy server is that it's cache can serve all users. If one or more Internet sites are frequently requested, these are likely to be in the proxy's cache, which will improve user response time. A proxy can also log its interactions, which can be helpful for troubleshooting.

## Understanding the Network Setups {#network-setups}

To implement a Network Setup, you must refer to the following scenarios with pros and cons. 

There are three major types of Network setups:

1. Internet Access Setup
1. Mobile Network Setup
1. Enclosed Corporate Network Setup

The following table outlines the different types of network setups with advantages and disadvantages:
