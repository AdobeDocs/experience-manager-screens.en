# Project Taxonomy {#project-taxonomy}

>[!NOTE]
>
>Typical stakeholder for this activity is an AEM Implementor.

Before you create an AEM Screens project, understand and strategize all the components defined in the UX Wireframing phase of the project.

Consider the following elements before implementing your AEM Screens digital signage solution:

* **Locations**
* **MediaZones**
* **Displays**
* **Scheduling**
* **Previewing the content**

To learn about these terms, see [Glossary](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/experience-manager-screens/user-guide/overview/screens-glossary).

>* hardware asset database to auto-populate a Screens project
>* text config file to automatically point every player to specific instance of an AEM

## Implementing an AEM Screens Project {#creating-a-project}

An AEM Screens author is responsible for creating and managing a user experience using the available components in AEM Screens. The author creates and reviews the content and provides an easy-to-use graphical user interface by configuring, deploying, and integrating the available segments of AEM Screens.

>[!NOTE]

>An author creates channels from the given sequences and knows the campaign audience and the desired focus. Thus, an AEM Screens author creates and orchestrates the user experience by creating different channels and assigning sequences into timed channel experience.

An author typically begins an AEM Screens project by:

* [creating an AEM Screens project](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/experience-manager-screens/user-guide/authoring/setting-up-projects/creating-a-screens-project)
* [creating channels](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/experience-manager-screens/user-guide/authoring/setting-up-projects/managing-channels)
* [adding components and assets to the channel](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/experience-manager-screens/user-guide/authoring/product-features/adding-components-to-a-channel)
* [creating schedules](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/experience-manager-screens/user-guide/authoring/setting-up-projects/managing-schedules)
* [creating locations](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/experience-manager-screens/user-guide/authoring/setting-up-projects/managing-locations)
* [creating displays](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/experience-manager-screens/user-guide/authoring/setting-up-projects/managing-displays)
* [assigning channels to the displays](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/experience-manager-screens/user-guide/authoring/setting-up-projects/assigning-channels/channel-assignment)

* [viewing content in an AEM Screens Player](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/experience-manager-screens/user-guide/administering/working-with-screens-player)

>[!NOTE]
>You can also bulk-import a set of locations from a CSV/XLS spreadsheet to your AEM Screens project. See [New Project Importer from File](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/experience-manager-screens/user-guide/administering/project-importer).
