Wireframes are a visual representation of the anticipated digital experience that we intend to deliver. 

This process can be applied to:

* Asset Level view
* Channel Level view
* Project Level view

This will help move the project from the prototyping phase closer to the actual deployment phase.

From an **Asset Level view**, we should create wireframes that define various content layout options and content groupings. This helps to define what multiple pieces of content may look like when assembled together as a group.
Typically, we would be using actual production-ready graphics, images and videos in this activity.

From a **Channel Level view**, we should create wireframes that show how channels of content are lnked together in the overall experience including playback strategies for embedded channels. We can also review channel transitions that may occur as data triggers are engaged.

On a **Project Level**, we can start to model how multiple screens or experiences can work together in a physical space to provide a complete multi-touchpoint user journey. 

This should align with the UX Journey map previously created.
