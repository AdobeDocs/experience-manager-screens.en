# User Experience Prototyping {#prototypes}

It is important to test the ideas, assumptions and dependencies previously defined in the UX Journey Map through the use of UX prototyping. 

In this phase of the project, we are concerned more about core functionality and less about refining the actual UX. 

Typically, sample or FPO content is used in this stage to help the project manager and key stakeholders identify any major gaps in the UX flow as well as any timing problems with the playback and related trigger events.
This phase can also reveal potential problems with asset positioning, scale and size.

By prototyping the experience, we can simulate various scenarios for how the content will be consumed, what interactions may occur and what external data dependencies may cause a disruption to the intended flow of the experience.

Various example Use Cases have been created to serve as a reference or starting point for prototyping specific experiences.

> For example, it is likely that not all decision makers are familiar with the data structure of their product database. They may choose descriptors on their UX solution that are not primary fields in the data layer. Identifying early where manipulation of the data may be necessary and communicating it to the client will prevent misunderstandings later. If the client decides to expand or alter the UI labelling after development has begun, more effort will be required to accommodate the changes.
