It is important to test the ideas, assumptions, and dependencies previously defined in the UX Journey Map by using UX prototyping. 

In this phase of the project, you should be concerned more about core functionality and less about refining the actual UX. 

Typically, sample or FPO content is used at this stage. It helps the project manager and key stakeholders identify any major gaps in the UX flow and any timing problems with the playback and related trigger events.
This phase can also reveal potential problems with asset positioning, scale, and size.

By prototyping the experience, you can simulate various scenarios for how the content is consumed, what interactions may occur and what external data dependencies may cause a disruption to the intended flow of the experience.

Various example Use Cases have been created to serve as a reference or starting point for prototyping certain experiences.


>[!NOTE]
> During the UX design phase, confirm that the UI design can be adequately supported by the data extracted.
> For example, it is likely that not all decision makers are familiar with the data structure of their product database. They may choose descriptors on their UX solution that are not primary fields in the data layer. Identifying early where manipulation of the data may be necessary and communicating it to the client prevents misunderstandings later. If the client decides to expand or alter the UI labeling after development has begun, more effort is required to accommodate the changes.
