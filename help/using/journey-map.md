A User Experience Journey Map is designed to provide visibility into how and why users experience the digital content delivered by the network.

## Building the UX Journey Map {#building-map}

Having a strong understanding of how consumers interact with a digital signage network in a physical space is critical to the success and value delivered by that network. It also helps to understand how the digital experience is consumed within the context of all the other channels a customer may encounter.

The UX Journey Map is a good way of visualizing how a visitor may move through a physical space and what elements they may encounter. It also helps to see how the digital experience delivered by the network may fill any gaps in the overall journey.

In this phase of the project, you may choose to define options and dependencies for dynamic or interactive content so that you can prototype them later. Such options would include a storyboard for each interaction, data trigger, or loop segment that the network delivers along with the KPIs defined in the Strategy Brief.

Let Project leaders and key stake holders experiment with the placement of digital elements along parts of the store journey. Let them observe the digital experiences that are delivered.
