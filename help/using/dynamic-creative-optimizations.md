**Dynamic Creative Optimization**, or DCO, is used to create digital signage experiences that reflect the unique circumstances of any given location at any given time and for any given user.

This usage is also referred to as Client Side flattening of content.

The reasoning is to ensure that each player device or end point can use data sets to determine the best content to play automatically based on various different factors.

This functionality eliminates the need for constant human intervention when content authoring. It also helps reduce the total cost of ownership to operate the network and makes the digital experiences more relevant, more contextual, and more effective.

Examples include:

* using the current inventory level of feature products
* outside temperature or weather
* the presence of a local media ad campaign
* web traffic and even local events like when a customer picks up a product to examine it

All of these examples and more can be used to provide a higher level of context and personalization.

Having a visual merchandising strategy that includes DCO can dramatically increase network viewership.

There are two main types of data triggers:

* **Local Data Triggers**: These data triggers are local on the device. For example, if you touched the screen, a sensor is activated that triggers a local data asset or channel switch.
* **Remote Data Triggers**: This involved data triggered channel switch or an asset switch based on values returned by a Web Service API.
