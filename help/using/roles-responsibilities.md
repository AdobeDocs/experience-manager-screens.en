# Project Roles and Responsibilities {#roles-responsibilities}

As an experienced AEM implementor, you will likely have seen the roles being referred to as *Authors*, *Developers*, and *IT/Technicians*.

In a typical AEM Screens project, the roles are further refined as they each serves important purpose in the project.

The diagram below shows the roles that we will refer to throughout the guide.

>[!NOTE]
> Many of these roles could be either in-house or outsourced, depending on how each project is set up.

## Defining Roles {#roles}

The following section provides an overview on the target audience:

### Adobe {#adobe-audience}

Adobe includes Adobe Managed Services resources like the CSE (Customer Success Engineer) and Adobe Support.

### AEM Implementors {#aem-implementors}

AEM Implementors are responsible for performing development and integration tasks to develop the user experience, custom templates, and back-end integrations for AEM.

Custom features required to address end-customer UX (User Experience) parameters are also captured and delivered through this process.

AEM Implementors will typically deploy custom functionality in phases over time to locations. For example, they might first establish support for playback of basic looped video or static graphic content. The next phase might include enabling the ability to support playback of  localized content through dynamic templates and metadata tags, with additional phases incorporating support for interactive elements via touch screens, sensors, dynamic triggers, and so on.

### AV Integrators {#av-integrators}

The A/V Integrator is the Hardware Vendor/Partner. This is the party that deals with retail design and site preparation, including hardware acquisition, configuration, and deployment. It is typically a contracted 3rd party who has access to a Network Operations Center (NOC). In many cases the A/V Integrator is the project owner due to its continuous involvement post-launch.

An AV Integrator is responsible for conducting discovery with end-customers to define requirements determining project scope to design, build and effectively manage deployments around digital signage hardware.

### Business Strategist {#business-strategist}

The Business Strategy represents the decision makers at the company. This role is heavily involved in the discovery and requirements stages and is the main driver of the project. 

They are the ones defining requirements and setting up KPI metrics. Business Strategy could be the following:

* Marketing or,
* Sales Manager Digital Strategy Manager Creatives / Content Management.

The Creatives and Content Management team work closely with the Strategy team and turn requirements into client experiences. They drive the overall UX design and curate contents that complements the brand.

The Creatives and Content Management could be the following:

* Creative Agency or,
* Brand Manager

### Project Managers {#project-managers}

Project Managers typically manage the entire deployment for your AEM Screens deployment. A project manager is the point person for the entire implementation of the designated project and performs major responsibilities such as setting timelines, handling team needs and communications, addressing challenges, and ensuring that goals are met.

## Project Stages {#project-stages}

To support a successful Digital Signage deployment, it is customary to segment the project into 3 stages.  These stages are commonly referred to as **Days**. These are not literal days but designations for each major stage of the project.

1. The first stage is referred to as *Day Zero*. This stage includes all pre-sales and discovery efforts required to fully define project scope.

1. The second stage, *Day One*, refers to all activities included in the deployment effort.

1. The third and final stage *Day Two* refers to all ongoing operations and support elements as part of the total solution.

>[!NOTE]
>
> While this guide puts emphasis primarily on *Day One* and *Day Two*, attention to all three stages is necessary to execute a successful digital signage project.

## RACI Chart {#raci-chart}

The following is a sample RACI chart using the role definitions.

>[!NOTE]

> This chart is not intended to be followed exactly but to provide an example of common tasks and considerations in an AEM Screens projects.

### RACI definitions {#raci-definitions}

* **Responsible**: Does the work to complete the task.

* **Accountable**: Delegates work and is the last party to review the task before it is complete.

* **Consulted**: Reviews the task or deliverable to provide input.

* **Informed**: Kept informed of progress on the task but is not involved in the details of the deliverable.

The following is a sample RACI chart using the role definitions and provides an example of common tasks and considerations in an AEM Screens project.
