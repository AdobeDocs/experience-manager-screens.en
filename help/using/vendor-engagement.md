# Vendor Engagement {#vendor-engagement}

>[!NOTE]
>A typical stakeholder for this activity is an Audio-Video Integrator.

In this activity, it is important to identify all the key vendors required in assembling and delivering the network and any partner dependencies:

* Identify vendors for all hardware including displays, player PCs, mounts and related peripherals.

* Define capabilities and tasks for each vendor as it relates to the product category they support.

* Confirm delivery *lead times* for all deliverables. Create a deployment plan that accommodates all lead times working backwards from one or more desired install dates of the first required installations.

By completing all the previous steps, you should now have a comprehensive *Day 1* deployment plan ready to execute.
