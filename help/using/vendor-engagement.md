# Vendor Engagement {#vendor-engagement}

>[!NOTE]
>Typical stakeholder for this activity is an A/V Integrator.

In this activity, it is important to identify all the key vendors required in assembling and delivering the network as well as any partner dependencies:

* Identify vendors for all hardware including displays, player PC's, mounts and related peripherals.

* Define capabilities and tasks for each vendor as it relates to the product category they support.

* Confirm delivery *leadtimes* for all deliverables and create a deployment plan that accommodates for all leadtimes working backwards from the desired install date(s) of the first required installations.

By completing all the previous steps, we should now have a comprehensive *Day 1* Deployment Plan ready to execute.
