>A typical stakeholder for this activity is a Marketing/Business Strategist.

Content is a major factor in driving engagement. In the pre-sales phase, it is important to define a business content strategy. That strategy considers how the application use hardware, software, and connectivity resources to deliver the intended value to your client's customers.

A well-defined business content strategy sets a path to create, distribute, and track the usage of content in relation to the buyer's journey. It also considers the marketing touch points in the sales funnel. Getting the right message to the right customer at the right time is crucial. 

Consider how the Screens application can help to achieve this strategy and determine KPIs to help measure the success of the application in delivering that content.

Review and answer the following questions when building a content strategy for your AEM Screens project:

* Who is the target audience and what is the anticipated dwell time?
* What content must be shown to them?
* Where do you anticipate content to have the most impact?
* When is the ideal time to engage the audience?
* Who is going to create the content?
* Why should the target audience care about the content?
* What problems is the content helping them solve? (For example, does the Screens application help a customer find the most suitable shoes to wear for extreme mountain climbing or a perfect appliance for their new home?)
* How does the customer interact with the application or how is the user experience?
* What is your update and upgrade strategy?
* How often do you anticipate the creation of new, needed content?

  >During the pre-sales stage, begin asking questions not only about what content is going to be shared, but where the content data currently resides. How is it going to be used in an AEM Screens project? Dig deep into content during implementation but establish upfront what data is available and in what format.
