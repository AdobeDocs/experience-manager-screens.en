# Day Two Platform Support and Maintenance {#day-two-support-maintenance}

AEM Screens requires several packages in order for projects to function. All environments should be running the same version of Adobe Experience Manager.

Follow the guidelines as support and maintenance for Day Two of project development phase:

1. Run the most current versions of the following packages for your version of Adobe Experience Manager:

   * **AEM Service Pack**
   * **Screens Feature Pack**
   * **AEM Cumulative Fix Pack**

1. Identify any development packages (for example, WCM Core components) or third-party toolkits (for example, SAP Hybris) that are required.

1. Install the same software packages on your local development environments.

1. Instruct your client to adopt the same configuration on all of their QA, Stage, and Production servers. Mismatched server configurations will create problems when deploying and testing.
