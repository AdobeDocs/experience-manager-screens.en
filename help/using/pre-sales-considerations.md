# Considerations as Projects are Scoped {#pre-sales-considerations}

>[!NOTE]
>Typical stakeholder for this activity is a Marketing/Business Strategist.

This stage includes all pre-sales and discovery efforts required to fully define the project scope. The work done during Day Zero sets the tone for the rest of the project and influences the overall success of the application being built.
At this stage, key vendors are identified and brought together to help formulate the project plan. It is important during this stage that buy-in is also established with key project stakeholders within the client company, such as Sales Executives, Marketing Managers, and IT teams as they will all have an important part to play in the development of the application and its continued maintenance.

## Key Deliverables {#key-deliverables}

Key deliverables at this stage include:

* Approved project plan (including scope of work, project schedule, and budget) with buy-in from key stakeholders.
* Defined teams with clear roles and responsibilities.
* Defined content strategy with short- and mid-term goals and a long-term vision.
* List of reporting needs and key performance indicators (KPIs).
* Draft deployment schedule and plan.

>Identify the data that will be needed for the application, and where it is coming from, as soon as possible. While deeper exploration will happen during implementation, take the time during *Day Zero* to find out what data the client intends to use, where that data is stored currently, and how it can be accessed by the application being built. Notifying the development team in advance of challenges that may lie ahead will help to make implementation go more smoothly.
