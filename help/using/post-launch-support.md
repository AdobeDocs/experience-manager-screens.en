# Post-launch support {#post-launch-support}


Do not overlook Post-launch support in the early stage. 

Ensuring sites receive adequate support from your hardware vendor is crucial for their business operations. The **Audio/Video Integrator** should work closely with business stakeholders and identify the requirements needed from different aspects.
Consider the following requirements during post-launch support:

* remote device management
* support center availability
* on-site technician support
* device management (warranty support and spare device storage)

Also, to prepare for long-term success, it is paramount to establish a Day 2 Service Level Agreement (SLA) in partnership with the Audio/Video Integrator. The SLA should detail all post-deployment support services to help accurately set client expectations.
