# Post Launch Support {#post-launch-support}


Post launch support must not be overlooked in the early stage. 

Ensuring sites receive adequate support from your hardware vendor is crucial for their business operations. The **A/V Integrator** should work closely with business stakeholders and identify the requirements needed from different aspects.
Consider the following requirements during post launch support:

* remote device management
* support center availability
* on-site technician support
* device management (warranty support and spare device storage)

Additionally, to prepare for long term success, it is paramount to establish a Day 2 Service Level Agreement (SLA) in partnership with the AV Integrator. The SLA should detail all post-deployment support services in order to help accurately set client expectations.

Is the deployment an Advertising Network with many stakeholders tied to a monetized network?  This may dictate much shorter resolution time frames compared to a Corporate Communications network.  
Is the application highly visible to the end client’s executive leadership? Sites with high visibility may merit different treatments. 
Is the application critical to business operations such as menu-boards in fast-food chains? In these cases, the end-client may require on-site resolutions with very short response times, as well as redundancy in playback hardware.
