# Single Use TakeOver Channel {#single-use-takeover-channel}

The following page showcases a use case that emphasizes on setting up a project on how to create a Single TakeOver channel that plays just once for a specific time.


## Use Case Description {#use-case-description}

This Use Case explains how to create a channel that *takes over* from the normally playing channel for a display or group of displays. The takeover will only occur once and for a specific time.
For example, there is a Single TakeOver channel that plays on Friday from 9AM to 10AM. During this time, no other channel should play. Before and after this time, the Single Use Takeover channel will not play. The following example showcases creation of a single takeover channel that plays allows the content to play for 2 minutes before 12:00 am on Dec 31 until 12:01 am.
