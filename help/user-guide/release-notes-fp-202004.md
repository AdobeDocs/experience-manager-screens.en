### What's New {#what-s-new}

* **Playback Interruption Strategy Options**

    As a Content Author, specify when a channel is interrupted. This action helps so you can choose to cut off non-critical content, but optionally let important content play entirely before cutting off play because of scheduling.

    To learn more about the options available from the **Channel Assignment** dialog box to implement this feature in your AEM Screens project, see the section **[Interruption Method](/help/user-guide/channel-assignment.md#interruption-method-channel)**.

* **Screens Launches**

   The Content Author user experience flow has been improved and reduced the number of clicks to use future publish. 

   See **[Content Update using Screens Launch](launches.md)** for more details.

* **Channel Dashboard**

   Reflects updates to instructions in the channel dashboard in the **CHANNEL INFORMATION** panel.


* **View Manifest**

   You can now view the manifest file from the channel dashboard.
   
   See **[Viewing the Manifest](/help/user-guide/managing-channels.md#view-manifest)**.

* **Text Overlay**

   While adding test to the text overlay function, the font size is precise and improved.

   To create a compelling experience in a Sequence Channel by providing a title or a description overlaid on top of an image, see **[Text Overlay](text-overlay.md)**.
