# Implementing Chrome OS Player  {#implementing-chrome-os-player}

This section describes how to implement the Chrome OS Player using the Chrome Management Console.

## Using Chrome Management Console {#using-chrome-management-console}

Follow the steps below to set up chrome management console:

1. Register for the Chrome Management Console. You need to obtain a license for Chrome Management Console. Contact [Google Support](https://support.google.com/chrome/a/answer/1375678?hl=en&ref_topic=2935995) to Manage Chrome device settings for more information.
1. Enroll your Chrome OS Device into the domain wait for 15 minutes for the device to sync with the Chrome Management Console. To learn more about enrolling chrome device, click [here](https://support.google.com/chrome/a/answer/1360534?hl=en).
1. The Chrome Player will be available in the Chrome Web store.

>[!NOTE]
>
>A device management solution such as the Chrome Management Console is recommended for deployment and management of Chrome OS Devices. Although, this document provides implementation for Chrome Management Console there are other vendors who claim to provide similar functionality. Please contact the vendor of your device management software.

## Naming Chrome OS Player {#name-chrome}

You can assign a user friendly device name to your Chrome player, thereby sending the assigned device name to Adobe Experience Manager (AEM). This capability not only allows you to name your Chrome player but also allows to you to easily assign appropriate content.

>[!NOTE]
>You can choose the Player name only before registration. Once the Player is registered, the Player name cannot be changed anymore.

Follow the steps below to configure the name in Chrome player:

1. You can optionally allow AV integrators or IT administrators to set the Asset ID and location as part of enterprise enrollment.

1. You can set the Asset ID as part of enterprise enrollment as well as in the Chrome management console.

    >[!NOTE]
    >Chrome Players must be enrolled in enterprise enrollment and the Chrome player must be deployed through Chrome Management Console, otherwise the asset ID will return blank (for example, chrome as an extension). The device name is only recorded at the time of registration. Future changes will not be picked up by Adobe Experience Manager (AEM).

### Enabling Kiosk Mode {#enabling-kiosk-mode}

Follow the steps below to enable the Kiosk mode:

1. Log in to the Chrome Developer Console.

### Policy attributes and purpose {#policy-attributes-and-purpose}

The following table summarizes the policies with their functions.

| **Policy Name** |**Purpose** |
|---|---|
| *server* |The URL to the Adobe Experience Manager Server |
| *resolution* |The resolution of the Chrome OS Device |
| *rebootSchedule* |The schedule to reboot the Chrome player |
| *enableAdminUI* |Enable the Admin UI for technicians to configure the device on site. Set to false once it is fully configured and in production. |
