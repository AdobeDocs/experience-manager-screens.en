## Troubleshoot OSGi Settings {#troubleshoot-osgi-settings}

You need to enable the empty referrer to allow the device to post data to the server. For example, if the empty referrer property is disabled, the device cannot post a screenshot back.

Currently some of these features are only available if the *Apache Sling Referrer Filter Allow Empty* is enabled in the OSGi configuration. The dashboard may display a warning that security settings may prevent some of these features from working.

Follow the steps below to enable the Apache Sling Referrer Filter Allow Empty

1. Navigate to **Adobe Experience Manager Web Console Configuration**, that is, `https://localhost:4502/system/console/configMgr/org.apache.sling.security.impl.ReferrerFilter`.
1. Check the **allow.empty** option.
1. Click **Save**.

### Recommendations {#recommendations}

The following section recommends monitoring the network links, server, and players to understand the health and react to issues.

AEM provides built-in monitoring for:

* *Heartbeat* every 5 seconds to indicates that the AEM Screens Player is in operation.
* *Screenshot* from the Player that shows what is currently displayed on the Player.
* The *AEM Screens Player Firmware* version installed on the Player.
* *Free storage space* on the Player.

Recommendations for remote monitoring with 3rd party software:

* CPU usage on Players.
* Check if AEM Screens Player process is running.
* Remote restart/reboot of the Player.
* Real-time Notifications.

It is recommended to deploy the Player hardware and OS in a way that allows remote login to diagnose issues and restart the Player.
