It is recommended to use Samsung Remote Management (RMS) solution for deploying and managing the solution. Refer to [Enrolling the Tizen Device to Samsung Remote Management Service (RMS)](#enroll-tizen-device-rm) for more details.

Follow the steps below steps to bulk provision the application to point to your AEM author instance when it launches:

1. Download and install the [Tizen Studio]( https://developer.tizen.org/development/tizen-studio/download).
1. Open the `wgt` file using Tizen studio.
1. Open the file `firmware-platform.js` and search for `DEFAULT_PREFERENCES` and change the server URL to the AEM author URL and save.
1. Build the new `wgt` file.

   >[!NOTE]
   >You may need to create or setup a signing certificate.
