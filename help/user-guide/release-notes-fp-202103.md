### What's New {#what-is-new}

* **AEM Screens Bulk Registration and Assignment** 

   Bulk registering thousands of players manually is very cumbersome and adds time and cost. To simplify this process, the Bulk Registration feature allows you to specify a pre-shared key in AEM that can be provisioned into a player either through a configuration file or an Mobile Device Management (MDM) solution.

* **Lock Page in an AEM Screens Channel**

   AEM Screens now supporting *Locking a Page*, as already implemented in AEM Sites. Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) allows you to lock a page, so that no one else can modify the contents. This is useful when you are making a lot of edits to one specific page or when you need to freeze a page for a short while.

### Bug Fixes {#bug-fixes}

*  Improved performance for computing `clientlib` and `asset hashes`.

* SmartSync migration would break the player, if cache was not invalidated.
