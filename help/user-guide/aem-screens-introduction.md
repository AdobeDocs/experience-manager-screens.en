To learn how to configure and create your Experience Manager Screens project in Experience Manager as a Cloud Service, see [here](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/experience-manager-screens/using/about-guide).

## Overview {#overview}

**Experience Manager Screens** is built on the solid foundation of ***Experience Manager Sites***. It enables marketers and IT personnel to create and manage experiences on multiple digital screens that impact in-store/in-venue goals for building brand and driving demand. Integration of Experience Manager Screens with Sites lets you reuse existing content and effectively deliver a coherent and consistent customer solution. This provides a streamlined workflow to create dedicated digital experiences that are highly cost-effective and usable. It further helps to influence brand perception and impact decisions leading to upliftment in purchase and engagement.

Experience Manager Screens is a powerful web-based solution that lets you create dedicated digital menu boards, product recommenders, background lifestyle imagery to expand customer interaction. It helps you deliver unified and useful brand experiences into physical venues, such as stores, hotels, banks, healthcare and educational institutions, and many more - from the same Experience Manager platform. Screens provide many unique applications such as interactive displays, way-finding, branding, and adding ambience to your environment for customers and employees based on the domain where these are deployed.

Creating and managing an application using Experience Manager Screens is simple and intuitive. An *application* hosts web pages built for Experience Manager Screens by customers or implementation partners. *Locations* manage pre-defined hierarchies and contain *displays*. Each display has a dashboard that shows different devices and screens attached. Content for Experience Manager Screens is managed in *channels*. Experience Manager Screens Player renders content present within channels onto displays.
