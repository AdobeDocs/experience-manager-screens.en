# Part 3: Testing, POCs, Pilots & Rollouts {#part-testing-pocs-pilots-rollouts}

This page highlights part 3 of a 5-part series designed to help team members better understand the key terms critical in ensuring a successful solution can be developed before a rollout.

## Overview {#overview}

This tutorial covers the following points relevant to a successful deployment of a project plan:

* Identify areas often underestimated as part of the overall project plan, including:
* Actions surrounding Hardware Lab Testing & Performance Validation
* Systems & Software Integration Testing
* Proofs of Concept (also called POCs) and Pilot programs
* End-to-End Testing

>[!NOTE]

>Typical Sales cycles for Digital Signage deployment at scale can range from 9 through 18 months. There are many factors involved that affect the final time line, not the least of which is how the end-client measures success and how risk averse their business partners are when introducing a new solution.

For example, stakeholders for a digital signage program in a retail environment could include the following:

* In-Store Marketing
* Store Environment or Visual Merchandising
* Store Operations
* IT Security
* IT Support
* The product category Merchant and their supplier, who may be co-funding the solution.

## Summary of Key Terms involved in an Overall Project Plan {#summary-of-key-terms-involved-in-an-overall-project-plan}

The following section provides an overview on the key terms involved in an overall project plan such as project cycle, actions surrounding hardware testing, Proof Of Concept, pilots and roll outs.

### Proof of Concept (POC) {#proof-of-concept-poc}

The purpose of a POC is to gain initial feedback on a solution's key functionalities. It also lets both the end-client and AV Integrator an opportunity to identify areas for improvement and prepare assumptions surrounding labor requirements and resource demands. A POC also lets both parties assess the solution's performance, which is typically measured through:

### Quality Control {#quality-control}

Systems & Software Integration testing begins with the AV Integrator's IT Engineering team. Referencing the approved system design, the IT Engineering Team configures, implements, and supervises the installation of hardware components in a "Lab environment" in the AV Integrator's facility. This allows for close review and testing of the entire solution for quality control.

Once QC testing is complete the IT Engineering Team creates documentation, workflows, and training for reference during Day-2 support. Systems aspects to be tested include:

* AEM Implementor Integrations
* Third-Party Systems Integrations
* Software
* Hardware
* Connectivity
* Content Deployment workflows including manual, automated and conditional deployments.

## Part 3: Video Tutorial on Testing, POCs, Pilots & Rollouts {#part-video-tutorial-on-testing-pocs-pilots-rollouts}

Follow the tutorial below to understand Testing, Proofs of Concept, Pilot Programs, and Rollouts.

Considering all these stages as part of the overall project plan helps manage expectations and identifies natural points in which the investment in an AEM Screens deployment can be evaluated.
