# Create and manage schedules {#creating-and-managing-schedules}

**Schedules** in AEM Screens let you organize channels into reusable groups. Doing so means that you do not have to repeat their assignment individually for each display on which you want to show your content.

Schedules, when combined with ***DayParting***, lets you set a global schedule with multiple channels running at specific times of the day, and reuse that set up for all your displays at once.

>[!NOTE]

>This AEM Screens functionality is only available if you have installed AEM 6.3 Sites Feature Pack 1. To get access to this Feature Pack, contact Adobe Support and request access. After you have the necessary permissions, you can download it from Package Share.
