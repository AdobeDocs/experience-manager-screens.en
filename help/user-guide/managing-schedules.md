# Creating and Managing Schedules {#creating-and-managing-schedules}

**Schedules**, in AEM Screens, lets you organize channels into re-usable groups so that you do not have to repeat their assignment individually for each display on which you want to show your content.

Schedules when combined with ***DayParting***, allows you to set a global schedule with multiple channels running at specific times of the day, and re-use that setup for all your displays at once.

>[!NOTE]

>This AEM Screens functionality is only available, if you have installed AEM 6.3 Sites Feature Pack 1. To get access to this Feature Pack, you must contact Adobe Support and request access. Once you have permissions you can download it from Package Share.
