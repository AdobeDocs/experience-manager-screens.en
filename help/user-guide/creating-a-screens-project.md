>By default, the initial structure will contain the **Schedules**, **Locations**, **Applications**, **Channels**, and **Devices** master pages, but this can be manually adjusted if needed. You can remove the options, if the available ones are not relevant to your project.

The project is created and it brings you back to the Screens Project console. You can now select your project.

In a project, there are four kind of folders, as shown in the figure below:
