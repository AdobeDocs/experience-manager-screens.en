# Creating and Managing Projects {#creating-and-managing-projects}

The AEM Screens is available by selecting the Adobe Experience Manager link (top left) and then Screens.

Alternatively, you can navigate directly to: `http://localhost:4502/screens.html/content/screens`


>[!NOTE]
>**Navigation Tip:**
>You can also use the cursor keys to navigate through different folders in AEM. Additionally, once you select a particular entity, hit space bar to edit or view properties for that specific folder.

## Creating a New Screens Project {#creating-a-new-screens-project}

Follow the steps below to create a new Screens project:

1. Select **Screens** from your AEM instance.

1. Click **Create Screens Project**.

1. Enter the title as **TestScreens** and click **Save**.

The project is created and it brings you back to the Screens Project console. You can now select your project.

In a project, there are four kind of folders, as shown in the figure below:

* **Schedules**

>By default, the initial structure will contain the **Schedules**, **Locations**, **Applications**, **Channels**, and **Devices** master pages, but this can be manually adjusted if needed. You can remove the options, if the available ones are not relevant to your project.
