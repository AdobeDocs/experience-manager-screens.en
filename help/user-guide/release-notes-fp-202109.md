### What's New {#what-is-new}

* **Thumbnail Support for Videos**

   Thumbnail Support for videos in now supported in AEM Screens. A content author can define a thumbnail for videos so that the image can be used as a placeholder and properly test content playback and targeting, while the actual video is being finalized by the appropriate team. The image can also be used, in case the playback of the video fails.
   See Thumbnail Support for Videos for more details.

* **Basic Playback Monitoring**

   AEM Screens now supports basic playback monitoring. The player will now report various playback metrics with each ping (defaults to 30 seconds). Based on the metrics, it provides the ability to detect various edge cases (stuck experience, blank screen, scheduling problem, etc.). This feature allows the team to remotely monitor if a player is properly playing content, improves reactivity to blank screens or broken experiences in the field, and decreases the risk of showing a broken experience to the end user.
   See Basic Playback Monitoring for more details.
