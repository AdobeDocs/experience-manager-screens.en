**Application Channel** &ndash; An Application Channel shows an application created by a developer that displays interactive content.

**Attract Loop** &ndash; An attract loop is defined as the *home* or *idle* state when the display has two or more states that it can exist in. Its role is to *attract* customers over to the display and encourage them to engage, usually by touching the screen but could also be by interacting with a product.

**DayParting** &ndash; DayParting refers to splitting up a day into time slots and specifying which content plays at the desired time. AEM Screens lets you schedule channels in terms of DayParting within a day, week, or month as per the requirement.

**Device** &ndash; A device can run the player software to produce a visual output. It is able to control displaying a cropped, scaled, translated portion of common content or experience. The screen configuration is bound to a display but can be replaced in case a technical defect occurs.

**Display** &ndash; A display is a virtual grouping of screens that are positioned next to each other. The display is permanent in respect to an installation. This is the object content authors work with and always reference to as logical display rather than their physical counter parts.

**Firmware** &ndash; Firmware is the term given to the software that runs on the device inside the player application in a web view. It is a JavaScript layer that runs the content contained in a channel within iFrames and provides access to native capabilities through plugins. The firmware can be updated without updating the player application.

**Player Software** &ndash; The player is the software application running on a device that lets you show a channel on a display.

**Screen** &ndash; A screen is a physical monitor or any other system capable of producing visual output that shows the content coming from its device.

**Sequence Channel** &ndash; A Sequence Channel is a page that you can author containing components that show one by one in a slideshow.

**Zones** &ndash; Zones are segmentation of displays that are used primary addressable entities for channels. In instances, where displays span multiple screens it is advantageous to define the zones to match the screen dimensions, especially if the screens show a prominent physical border.
