# Using Adaptive Renditions {#adaptive-renditions}

## Introduction {#introduction}

Adaptive Renditions allow the devices to automatically select the best rendition for a device based on customer-defined rules. The devices will automatically download and play the most appropriate rendition of an asset based on these rules allowing customers to only focus on designing the *main* experience.

## Objective {#objective}

As an AEM Screens Content Author, you can now configure device-specific asset renditions to be downloaded and played automatically without having to create all content variations manually.
