# Channel Level Bulk Image Playback Duration {#channel-level-bulk-image-playback-duration}

## Overview {#overview}

Once you create a sequence channel and add images to it, by default, all images will assume the playback duration defined in the Channel level configuration. Any individual image can still override the default and have a different playback duration, this is accomplished by editing the playback duration of the specific image component.

### Prerequisites {#prerequisites}

Before you start implementing this functionality, make sure you have set up a project as a prerequisite to start implementing this functionality. For example,

1. Create an AEM Screens project example, **ChannelLevelPlayback**. 

1. Create a sequence channel as **PlaybackChannel** under **Channels** folder.

1. Add content to **PlaybackChannel**.
