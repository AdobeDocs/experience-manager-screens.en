# Project Level Image Playback Duration {#project-level-image-playback}

## Overview {#overview}

This features lets you define image playback duration at the project level. All images inherit this playback duration by default. If no duration is defined at the project level, the default playback of 8 seconds will continue.

### Prerequisites {#prerequisites}

Before you use this feature, make sure you set up a project as a prerequisite to start implementing this functionality. For example,

1. Create an AEM Screens project (in this example, **ProjectLevelPlayback**)  

1. Create a sequence channel as **PlayBackChannel** under **Channels** folder

1. Add content to **PlayBackChannel**
