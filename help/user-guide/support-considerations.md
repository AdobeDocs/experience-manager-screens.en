# Part 5: Support Considerations {#part-support-considerations}

This page highlights the concluding part of a 5-part series designed to help team members learn how hardware, software and connectivity issues are addressed. This phase explores cost estimations and frameworks for on-site support. Additionally also explains how SLA parameters, operational budgets, and NOC handoffs are managed.

## Overview {#overview}

>[!NOTE]
>
>Day 2 begins once the following are completed:
>
>* Project deployment to the field
>* Verification of device connectivity and operation between the installation technician and the NOC (Network Operations Center)
>
>Before Day 2 begins, planning for ongoing life-cycle budgets should be performed.

The planning includes:

* Addressing hardware, software or connectivity failures
* Balancing issue resolution costs against end-client business requirements.
* Identifying the best method for re mediating issues across the network.
* Driving alignment between the AEM Implementor and the AV Integrator in establishing Day 2 Support plans

## Summary of Key Considerations Involved in Day 2 Support {#summary-of-key-considerations-involved-in-day-support}

Following are some key considerations for Day 2 Support:

* To ensure alignment and smooth transition from implementation to operational support, the AEM Implementor must work with the AV Integrator to ensure appropriate support scripts are defined as part of the Day 2 Support plan.
* Requirements such as remote device management, Help Desk availability and on-site technician support are practically a given at this stage of the Digital Signage industry’s evolution. Beyond these base-line needs, AV Integrators should also explore cost variables between pro-active vs. reactive monitoring and support models.

* Requirements such as remote device management, Help Desk availability and on-site technician support are practically a given at this stage of the Digital Signage industry’s evolution. Beyond these base-line needs, AV Integrators should also explore cost variables between pro-active vs. reactive monitoring and support models.
* To prepare for long term success, it is paramount to establish a Day 2 Support Level Agreement (also called an ‘S.L.A.’) in partnership with the AV Integrator. SLAs detail post-deployment support services and will help to set client expectations.
* A key resource used in the successful management of multiple networks is the Knowledge Base. SharePoint is a popular platform for this type of resource. The Knowledge Base includes pre-scripted Q&A for NOC agents to follow, ensuring inbound issue resolution requests are handled in a consistent manner. Knowledge Bases typically include reference materials for system configurations and site locations including cut-sheets for hardware and reference materials for systems software. 
* Monitoring and management capabilities are largely dependent on Media Player Operating Systems and screen capabilities. Windows Operating Systems offer the greatest level of detail. For deployments running on Android or iOS devices, Mobile Device Management (also known as MDM) is employed.
* Some screen manufacturers offer the ability to monitor screens independent of Media Players, while others require an external device.
* AV Integrators leverage a mix of technologies, so solutions remain flexible to best address the end-client’s needs.
