# Part 5: Support Considerations {#part-support-considerations}

This page highlights the concluding part of a 5-part series designed to help team members learn how hardware, software, and connectivity issues are addressed. This phase explores cost estimations and frameworks for on-site support. Also, explains how SLA parameters, operational budgets, and NOC handoffs are managed.

## Overview {#overview}

>[!NOTE]
>
>Day 2 begins once the following are completed:
>
>* Project deployment to the field
>* Verification of device connectivity and operation between the installation technician and the NOC (Network Operations Center)
>
>Before Day 2 begins, planning for ongoing life-cycle budgets should be performed.

The planning includes:

* Addressing hardware, software or connectivity failures
* Balancing issue resolution costs against end-client business requirements.
* Identifying the best method for remediating issues across the network.
* Driving alignment between the AEM Implementor and the Audio-Video Integrator in establishing Day 2 Support plans

## Summary of Key Considerations Involved in Day 2 Support {#summary-of-key-considerations-involved-in-day-support}

The following are some key considerations for Day 2 Support:

* To ensure alignment and smooth transition from implementation to operational support, the AEM Implementor works with the Audio-Video Integrator. Together, they ensure that the appropriate support scripts are defined as part of the Day 2 Support plan.
* Requirements such as remote device management, Help Desk availability and on-site technician support are practically a given at this stage of the Digital Signage industry's evolution. Beyond this baseline need, Audio-Video Integrators should also explore cost variables between pro-active vs. reactive monitoring and support models.
* Requirements such as remote device management, Help Desk availability and on-site technician support are practically a given at this stage of the Digital Signage industry's evolution. Beyond this baseline need, Audio-Video Integrators should also explore cost variables between pro-active vs. reactive monitoring and support models.
* To prepare for long-term success, it is paramount to establish a Day 2 Support Level Agreement (also called an 'S.L.A.') in partnership with the Audio-Video Integrator. SLAs detail post-deployment supported services and help to set client expectations.
* A key resource used in the successful management of multiple networks is the Knowledge Base. SharePoint is a popular platform for this type of resource. The Knowledge Base includes pre-scripted Q&A for NOC agents to follow, ensuring inbound issue resolution requests are handled in a consistent manner. Knowledge Bases typically include reference materials for system configurations and site locations. The Knowledge Base can sometime include cut-sheets for hardware and reference materials for systems software. 
* Monitoring and management capabilities are largely dependent on Media Player Operating Systems and screen capabilities. Windows Operating Systems offer the greatest level of detail. For deployments running on Android&trade; or iOS devices, Mobile Device Management (also known as MDM) is employed.
* Some screen manufacturers offer the ability to monitor screens independent of Media Players, while others require an external device.
* Audio-Video Integrators use a mix of technologies, ensuring that solutions remain flexible for best addressing the end-client's needs.

Follow this concluding tutorial to a 5-part series tutorial below that stresses on ensuring alignment and smooth transition from implementation to operational support. It also explains how an AEM Implementor must work with the Audio-Video Integrator to ensure appropriate support scripts that are defined as part of the Day 2 Support plan.
