# Content Assignment Report {#content-assignment-report}

The Content Assignment Report feature allows an AEM Screens administrator or an author to export a *Content Assignment Report* in a spreadsheet format.

## Using Content Assignment Report {#using-content-assignment-report}

The Content Assignment Report allows an AEM Screens author or an administrator to download the report that contains all the assets such as images, videos in all Channels created in an AEM Screens project. Also, it includes the information of the entire channels assigned to all designated displays and henceforth all the devices assigned to their designated Displays.

The Content Assignment Report not only allows a preview of all the Channels, Assets, Displays, and Devices in the selected AEM Screens project but also provides a high-level structure of your project.
