# Part 2: Considerations as Projects are Scoped {#part-considerations-as-projects-are-scoped}

This page highlights part 2 of a 5-part series designed to help team members better understand pre-sales aspects for developing successful AEM Screens deployments.

## Overview {#overview}

The following tutorial covers the elements that must be identified during project discovery along with stakeholder input to assess the project and prepare an appropriate design.

The primary components of a digital signage program required for a successful deployment are:

* Content Strategy
* Business Operations Requirements
* IT & Network Environment Discovery
* AV Requirements
* Equipment Specification
* Site Readiness

>Define a Content Strategy that considers how the application uses software, hardware, and connectivity resources to successfully deliver the intended value.

## Summary of Project Considerations in a Digital Signage  {#summary-of-project-considerations-in-a-digital-signage}

When developing a Content Strategy there are several considerations including I/O Layers, Asset Types, Audience Segmentations, and Day-Part Schedule requirements.

### I/O Layers {#i-o-layers}

I/O drive conditional playback of content based on sensing audience proximity. For example, when a sensor detects proximity, content playback can change from 'attract' or passive content to 'engage' or interactive playback. This is especially helpful in applications where serving content based on demographics is desired.

### Content Asset Types {#content-asset-types}

To help you understand end-client intent regarding Content Assets, consider the following points:

* Whether content is repurposed from print, TV or Web campaigns?
* Whether content consists of static images or templates incorporating dynamically fed components?
* Are animations played back as Video or HTML programs?
* Are there third-party integrations from Content Subscription services, Social Media, or RSS aggregation services or API calls?
* What are the image resolution requirements?
* Are screens standard 16:9 aspect ratios or custom? Portrait or Landscape?
* Are multi-screen video walls required? If so, what are the configurations?
* Is content tied to operational or advertising revenues requiring fail-over strategies to prevent down-time?

### Audience Segmentation, Day Parts {#audience-segmentation-day-parts}

Enlisting Day-Part strategies can allow end-clients to segment their content and target messaging to the right audience at the right time. This is especially effective for Advertising or Retail networks where many content contributors comprise the whole of a playlist.

### Business Operations Requirements {#business-operations-requirements}

Business Operations are also important to define in Content Strategy conversations. Formalizing end-clients' support requirements can help manage expectations post-deployment, ensuring support efforts are measured appropriately.

### A/V Requirements {#a-v-requirements}

Mounting scenarios also need definition, as do considerations surrounding device access for servicing of equipment. This impacts not only initial installation labor and equipment recommendations but also determine the ongoing service and support requirements.

### Site Readiness {#site-readiness}

The final step in the Pre-Sales process is determining Site Readiness. This can be facilitated through site surveys that capture site, project, and progress details. Site Readiness essentially captures current state of a location before install, calling out any items the customer must prepare or plan to address before a technician arrive. Typically, this includes items such as power, data, furniture removal, and elimination of dust.

## The Next Step {#the-next-step}

When you understand the elements that are identified during project discovery, along with stakeholder input to assess the project and prepare an appropriate design, learn the key terms involved in an overall project plan. Such terms include project cycle, actions surrounding hardware testing, Proof Of Concept, pilots, and rollouts.
