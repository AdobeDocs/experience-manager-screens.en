# Travel Center Temperature Activation {#travel-center-temperature-activation}

The following use case demonstrates the usage of travel center local temperature activation based on the values populated in Google Sheets.

## Description {#description}

For this Use Case, if your Google Sheets has Value less than 50, then an image with hot drinks will display and if the value is greater than or equal to 50, then the image with cold drinks will display. In case of some other or no value, the player will display a default image.

## Preconditions {#preconditions}

Before you start implementing the travel center local temperature activation, you must learn how to set up ***Data Store***, ***Audience Segmentation*** and ***Enable Targeting for Channels*** in an AEM Screens Project.
